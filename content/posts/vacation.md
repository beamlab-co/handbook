At Beamlab, we believe that a healthy work-life balance is essential for the well-being and productivity of our employees. We understand the importance of taking time off to recharge, spend quality time with loved ones, and pursue personal interests. Therefore, we offer various paid time offs (PTOs) to all our employees. 

Please use your leave to go on vacations, or just do a staycation. We encourage you to plan breaks in between the work year to prevent burnout and to come back feeling recharged and raring to go. You may accumulate up to a maximum of 5 days of annual leave to be carried forward to the next year.

This policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for taking time off.

## Annual Leave

Employees who have a tenure of less than 3 years are eligible for 12 days of vacation leave. For employees with over 3 years of service, an extra one day of vacation leave are granted for each year beyond the initial 3 years. 

As an example, if you have been with us for 10 years, your total vacation leave is calculated as follows:
```
Annual Leave = 12 days
Additional Leave = (10-3) * 1 days = 7 * 1 days = 7 days
Total Annual Leave = 19 days
```

## Family and Medical Leave

Under certain circumstances, you may be eligible for family and medical leave of 12 days. If you need to take a leave for such reasons, please contact your supervisor to discuss eligibility and the required documentation.

## Bereavement Leave

We understand that losing a loved one is a challenging time. We offer bereavement leave of upto 13 days to allow you to attend to family matters and grieve in your time of loss. The duration of bereavement leave may vary based on the relationship and circumstances.

## Maternity & Paternity Leave

We prioritize family well-being and offer Maternity Leave to expectant mothers who have completed 3 years of continuous service, providing 12 weeks of paid leave for childbirth and bonding time. Eligible fathers with 3 years of service are granted 2 weeks of paid Paternity Leave to support their partners and new children. To ensure a smooth process, employees should notify their supervisor and the HR department 2 months prior to the start of leave. We are committed to fostering a supportive work environment that accommodates the diverse needs of our employees' families.

## Requesting Leave

To request any type of leave, please follow these steps:

- Submit your leave application at least 2 working days in advance for each day of leave taken. So if you're thinking of taking a week vacation, please inform your supervisor at least 2 weeks in advance. 
- Complete any required leave request forms or documentation.
- Provide relevant details, such as the reason for leave, anticipated start and end dates, and any additional information.

## Return to Work

Upon your return from leave, we are committed to ensuring a smooth transition back to work. Please communicate with your supervisor to discuss any accommodations or adjustments that may be needed.
