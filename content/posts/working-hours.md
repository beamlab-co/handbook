## Work from Home on Wednesdays 
<!-- (Flexible work arrangement) -->

At Beamlab, we recognize the importance of work-life balance and offer the opportunity for employees to work from home on Wednesdays. This flexible arrangement is designed to help you manage your tasks and responsibilities while enjoying a change of environment. To ensure a productive and successful work-from-home experience, please follow these guidelines:

### Communication

Maintain open communication with your team, supervisor, and colleagues. Use digital communication tools (Discord & Email) to stay connected and informed about ongoing projects and updates. Let your team know about your availability and preferred communication channels for the day.

### Workspace Setup

Designate a quiet and comfortable workspace that is free from distractions. Ensure your home environment supports focused work and minimizes interruptions. Set up your computer, phone, and any required tools or materials in your designated workspace.

### Technology and Connectivity

Ensure you have a reliable internet connection that can support your work tasks, video calls, and collaboration tools.

### Schedule and Availability

Start your workday at the same time you would if you were in the office. Maintain regular working hours and adhere to your usual schedule. Be available for team meetings, discussions, and collaboration during your working hours.

### Dress and Professionalism

While a more relaxed dress code may apply when working from home, we still encourage you to dress in a manner that is suitable for video calls and maintains a professional image.

### Task Management

Prioritize your tasks for the day and create a to-do list. Use project management tools or task lists to keep track of your assignments. Maintain your productivity by staying focused on your work and minimizing personal distractions.

### Breaks and Wellness

Take regular breaks throughout the day to stretch, rest your eyes, and recharge. Use these breaks to step away from your workspace and engage in activities that promote well-being. Stay hydrated and have a balanced lunch to sustain your energy levels.

### Accessibility

Ensure you remain accessible to your team and respond promptly to messages, emails, and requests. Keep your calendar up to date and let others know if you step away from your desk.

### End of Day Routine

Complete your work tasks for the day and update your team on your progress. Log off at the end of your working hours and signal the end of your workday.

### Feedback and Improvement

Share your feedback about the work-from-home experience with your supervisor. Your insights can help us enhance this flexible arrangement.

At Beamlab, effective communication is key to our success. We utilize various communication channels to ensure that information flows smoothly across the organization. This may include email, instant messaging platforms, video conferences, and internal intranet systems.

- Be punctual and prepared for meetings.
